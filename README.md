# Osmic (OSM Icons)

A collection of clean high quality SVG map icons licensed under CC0 (Public Domain).

![Osmic (OSM Icons)](https://github.com/nebulon42/osmic/raw/master/icons.png "Available icons")

Icons are heavily inspired by
* Maki ([mapbox/maki](https://github.com/mapbox/maki))
* Nori (as referenced in [hotosm/HDM-CartoCSS](https://github.com/hotosm/HDM-CartoCSS/blob/master/icons/poi/_nori.svg))
* Open-SVG-Map-Icons ([twain47/Open-SVG-Map-Icons](https://github.com/twain47/Open-SVG-Map-Icons))

## Icon Features
All icons should adhere to the following features
* flat (single colour, no gradients, no outlines)
* clean (reduced complexity where possible)
* sharp (aligned to pixel grid)
* single point of view (avoid use of perspective where possible)
* common canvas size
* avoid Inkscape specific code, use plain SVG

## Icon specifications
All icons use a canvas base size of 16px. Where required there exist several versions that are varying in size and amount of detail. The size is indicated by appending the pixel value to the icon name (e.g. hospital-16.svg).
